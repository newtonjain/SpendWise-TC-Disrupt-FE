# Go Price Predictor Application

This is a basic Go application for predicting prices.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Go project**: Start by creating a new directory for your project and initializing it as a Go module. Then, create a `main.go` file with the basic structure of your application.

2. **Google Cloud Deployment**: You can deploy your Go application to Google Cloud using Google Cloud Run or Google App Engine.

   - **Google Cloud Run**: Create a Dockerfile for your application, build a Docker image, and then deploy that image to Cloud Run. Here is a basic Dockerfile for a Go application:



```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go mod download
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .

FROM alpine:latest  
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /SpendWise-TC-Disrupt-FE/backend .
CMD ["./main"]
```

   - **Google App Engine**: Create an `app.yaml` file for your application and then deploy your application using the `gcloud` command-line tool. Here is a basic `app.yaml` file for a Go application:

```yaml
runtime: go113
```

Then, you can deploy your application using the following command:

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

Please note that you need to have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured on your machine to deploy your application to Google Cloud. Also, you need to have a Google Cloud project and enable the necessary APIs (Cloud Run API for Cloud Run and App Engine Admin API for App Engine).

Remember, this is a very basic guide and doesn't include any error handling, data validation, or actual logic for your application. You'll need to implement those parts yourself.
